## Features

- ‚ú® Lightweight and responsive GUI
- üñºÔ∏è Theme customization (colors, font sizes, and visibility toggles)
- üß© Split editor with support for icons and pagination
- üîß Config editor for managing themes and splits

## Binaries

OpenSpeedRun provides 3 executables:

- `openspeedrun`: the main GUI speedrun timer
- `openspeedrun-cli`: a command-line tool to control the timer externally (e.g., split, reset, pause)
- `openspeedrun-cfg`: configuration GUI to manage themes and splits

## üì¶ Install from Releases

Precompiled binaries are available for **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS** in the [Releases](https://github.com/tu_usuario/OpenSpeedRun/releases) section.

### ü™ü Windows

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/tu_usuario/OpenSpeedRun/releases) page.
2. Download the `.zip` for Windows (e.g. `openspeedrun-windows-x86_64.zip`).
3. Extract it anywhere (e.g. `C:\Games\OpenSpeedRun\`).
4. Run `openspeedrun.exe`.

> ‚úÖ You can also run `openspeedrun-cfg.exe` for configuration.

---

### üêß Linux

1. Download the `.zip` for Linux (e.g. `openspeedrun-linux-gnu-x86_64.zip`).
2. Extract it:
   ```bash
   unzip openspeedrun-linux-gnu-x86_64.zip
   ```
3. Move the binaries to somewhere in your PATH, or run from current directory:
   ```bash
   ./openspeedrun
   ```

> üí° You may need to make the binaries executable:
> ```bash
> chmod +x openspeedrun openspeedrun-cfg openspeedrun-cli
> ```

---

### üçé macOS

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently untested on macOS. You can try the following steps:

1. Download the macOS zip file (e.g. `openspeedrun-macos-x86_64.zip`).
2. Extract it:
   ```bash
   unzip openspeedrun-darwin-x86_64.zip
   ```
3. Run from terminal:
   ```bash
   ./openspeedrun
   ```

> üõ°Ô∏è If you get a ‚Äúcannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer‚Äù error, try:
> ```bash
> chmod +x openspeedrun
> xattr -d com.apple.quarantine openspeedrun
> ```

## Build From Source

Build with Cargo:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Or install directly:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

To start the timer:

```bash
openspeedrun
```

To configure splits and themes:

```bash
openspeedrun-cfg
```

## External Control via CLI

`openspeedrun` includes a companion binary: `openspeedrun-cli`, designed for both **Wayland** and **X11** environments.

Since many Wayland compositors do not support global hotkeys, and even on X11 you may prefer custom shortcuts, `openspeedrun-cli` allows you to control the timer externally.

You can bind system-wide keyboard shortcuts in your window manager or compositor to commands like:

```bash
openspeedrun-cli split
```
This enables full control (start, pause, reset, split) without relying on the GUI, ensuring compatibility and flexibility in any environment.
